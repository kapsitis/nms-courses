FYS Pre-assessment Test
=================================================

Welcome to the RBS Intro Week! 
This test is a preliminary activity and could help to reveal the 
progress you will make during the study year.
It does not entail any obligations
and will not affect your grades in any way.
Please, do not use Internet or calculators and and do not communicate with 
other people during this test!

For each question enter a short answer. 
It is highly recommended that you also provide a brief explanation, 
how did you arive to that answer.
The topics covered by this test include logic and algorithmic processes,
integer arithmetic, combinatorics, probabilities and statistics. 



**Question 1**

  .. image:: figs/function-graphs.png
     :width: 200 px

  Graphs of functions :math:`f(x)=x^2 - 7x + 10` and :math:`g(x) = x - 4` are shown. 
  Define function :math:`h(x)`:
  
  .. math::
  
     h(x) = \sqrt{\left( x^2 - 7x + 10 \right) \left( x - 4 \right)}.

  Find the domain of :math:`h(x)`.
  (The *domain* of a function is the set of all those :math:`x` for which the function is defined.)
  Write your answer as a set - number intervals or their unions.
      

  **Answer (the domain of h(x)):** ________________

**Question 3**

  In some country there are 1 million porcupines. 
  A new virus is infecting them: 
  Initially just one porcupine is infected; after one day the 
  number of infected porcupines is two. 
  In one more day the number of infected porcupines doubles again 
  and so on. 
  
  Assume that after :math:`N` days all 1 million porcupines are infected. 
  How many porcupines were infected :math:`10` days prior to that?
  You can give an estimate, if precise number is hard to compute.

**Question 4**
  Initially Jane stands in the point :math:`O(0,0)` of a coordinate plane. 
  After that she does all stages :math:`1` through :math:`10`:
  
  **Stage 1:** 
    She walks :math:`1` meter to the north and reaches point :math:`A_1(1,0)`. 
    Then she turns :math:`90^{\circ}` to the right and walks one more meter to the east reaching point :math:`B_1(1,1)`

  **Stage 2:**
    She turns left, walks :math:`2` meters, and reaches :math:`A_2`. Then she turns left again and walks 2 more meters
    reaching  :math:`B_2`.

  **Stage 3:**
    She turns right and walks :math:`3` meters, then turns right again and walks 3 more meters.	

  **(and so on)**
    . . .

  **Stage 10:**
    She turns left and walks 10 meters, then turns left again and walks 10 more meters. 

  At every stage she increases both distances by 1 meter; 
  on even stages she turns :math:`90^{\circ}` to the left twice; on odd 
  stages she turns :math:`90^{\circ}` to the right twice.
  
  What are the coordinates :math:`(x;y)` of the final point  :math:`B_{10}` where she arrives after all ten stages?

**Question 6**

  .. image:: figs/square-rectangles.png
     :width: 140 px

  A square was divided into four smaller squares; 
  each square is further divided into several equal rectangles
  as shown in the figure. 
  Find the smallest length of the side of the original square 
  :math:`a` such that all the rectangles in the figure
  have integer sizes in centimeters (*integer size* means 
  that the side has whole number of centimeters rather than 
  a fraction).

**Question 7**
  In a hospital there is a row of :math:`100` empty paper cups with numbers :math:`\#1,\#2,\ldots,\#100`.
  Alex passes this row one hundred times from the left to the right. 
  During the first pass he adds one pill in every cup. During 
  the 2nd pass he adds one pill in every other cup (cups with numbers :math:`\#2,\#4,\ldots`). During the 
  third pass he adds one pill in every 3rd cup, and so on. During the 100th pass he adds one pill to 
  every 100th cup (it is the cup :math:`\#100`).

**Question 8**

  As you may know, the number of days in a year can be divided by :math:`7` with a remainder. 
  In particular, 
  
  .. math::
  
     \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
	 365 = 52 \cdot 7 + 1,\\
	 366 = 52 \cdot 7 + 2.\\
	 \end{array} \right.

**Question 13**

  Assume that there is a :math:`12.5\%` excise tax on coffee.

**Question 15**

  .. image:: figs/histogram-for-age.png    
     :width: 200 px
	 

  The histogram shows the distribution of people in some company by age groups. 
  Each age group is a half-open interval :math:`[20;30)`, :math:`[30;40)`, and so on.
  Specifically, the leftmost bar in the histogram means that there are exactly two people of ages 
  from the interval :math:`[20;30)`. 
  
  Some employee Joe is such that 70% of the employees have ages not exceeding Joe's age.
  
  What is the smallest possible age of Joe?
